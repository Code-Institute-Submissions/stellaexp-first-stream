# Stream One - The Thali Rooms
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## UX

My UX process was to think what a user would want from a restaurant website. I started by researching what other restaurants included on their site and constructed some wireframes based on my research and knowledge.

I wanted the website to be clean and simple.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Existing Features
1. Sticky Navbar
* However far the user scrolls down, they will always have navigation at the top of their screen.
* On mobile, it utilises Bootstraps responsive 'Hamburger' menu
2. CSS on hover button
* This entices users to click on the button, to lead them onto finding out more about the restaurant.
3. jQuery Toggle Functionality
* Invited users to click on each block, revealing more about the restaurant.
4. Google Maps API
* This lets users see where the fictional restaurant is using Google Maps and allows them to interact with the map.
5. Bootstrap
* Bootstrap has responsive functionality that was particularly useful when it came to the images on the 'Menu' section of the site.

Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Features Left to Implement
Instead of a form, a live booking calander which shows what availability the restaurant has.

## Technologies Used
1. Bootstrap
2. Fontawesome
3. Google Fonts
4. Google Maps API

## JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

## Content
All content is fictional and the location of the restaurant is a random location in Hackney, East London.

## Media
All images are my own, taken from a trip to India in 2017.

I have embedded an Action Against Hunger Youtube video on the 'Vision' section of the site.

I used Bootstrap documentation and W3 schools tutorials to look up best coding practices. I have included links via comments for specific tutorials followed.
